# Lab Manual for Tiny to Tots Research Group

This lab manual was inspired by several others, and borrows heavily from them (e.g., [Aly Lab](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual) & [Morey Lab](https://ccmorey.github.io/labHandbook/)). It’s also a work in progress. If you have ideas about things to add, or what to clarify, feel free to let us (Sarah & Ross) know or start a conversation about it on Slack.

When you join the lab, you’re expected to read this manual and sign a form (*insert link here*) indicating that you have done so.

If you’re a PI or a trainee in a different lab and want to write your own lab manual, feel free to take inspiration from this one (and cite us!).

## Code of Conduct

### Policies

### Testing and Communicating with Participants

### Testing Developmental Populations

### Scientific Integrity

### Authorship Guidelines

## General Policies & Guidance

### DBS Checks

All lab members are required to obtain DBS (Disclosure & Barring Service) clearance. 	Staff requiring a DBS check should contact Andrea Freeman, Human Resources (FreemanA1@cf.ac.uk).  Students requiring a DBS check should contact Charlotte Ackerman, Registry (AckermanCL@cf.ac.uk). 

Undergraduate students can be reimbursed for the fee by submitting an [EXP1](https://intranet.cardiff.ac.uk/students/money/expenses/expenses-claim-procedure) form to psychfinance@cardiff.ac.uk with a request to charge this to the School Undergrad account. Employees and PhD students should discuss the fees directly with Ross & Sarah.

If you are unable to cover the costs of the DBS check upfront (and have these reimbursed after), please contact Ross & Sarah.

Information on the DBS process can be found on the DBS website: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service 

### Data Management

#### Writing Your Protocol

#### Keeping Study Logs

#### Backing Up Data

### Open Science

### Public Engagement

### Funding

### Ethics

Ethics paperwork should be drafted as early as possible. The School of Psychology Ethics Committee meets once per month, and all Box B proposals (most proposals involving minors fall under this category) need to be reviewed by the committee before being approved.

Proforma Guidance Notes (for the School of Psychology Ethics Committee) and example applications can be found in the rds drive under ADMIN/Ethics & Risk Assessments/Ethics

Updated ethics application information for the School of Psychology can be found on Inside Psych: https://inside.psych.cf.ac.uk/staff/ethics/application/

### Risk Assessments

Before submitting an ethics application, Risk Assessments need to be completed: 
https://inside.psych.cf.ac.uk/forms/risk_assessment/

Examples of full risk assessments for different types of experiments/spaces in CUCHDS can be found in the rds drive in the folder: ADMIN/Ethics & Risk Assessments/Risk Assessments

### GDPR Compliance

As of Summer 2018, the Tiny to Tots Research Panel became GDPR compliant in line with EU guidelines (for regulation details, see https://gdpr-info.eu/). Importantly, this means that:
1.	CONSENT
*	We ensure that we receive explicit consent from a parent/guardian to process the personal data we hold.
*	Consent is opt-in and granular. Consent is received as a clear yes/no with granular consent given for methods of contact.
* Consent is given freely.
*	Consent is informed. We provide details on what data will be processed and what it will be used for.
*	Consent can be withdrawn at anytime, easily. We clearly state how this can easily be achieved.
*	Consent is bound to a specified purpose. We clearly explain for what purpose we hold the data.
*	Consent is documented. We attach the electronic form whereby consent was given to every record.
*	Consent for those under the age of 16 is given by the holder of parental responsibility. 
2.	EMAIL MARKETING
*	We only email or contact individuals via a method if we have expressly received consent to do so. This includes study invites and distribution of newsletters/emails of interest.
3. PRIVACY BY DESIGN
*	Our database was created with data protection in mind. We deliberately chose REDCap software and ensured we had sufficient data security when creating this database.
4. RECORDS OF PROCESSING ACTIVITIES
*	We maintain records of when and how we used this data within each record. 
*	REDCap automatically logs all activity.
*	We are able to demonstrate our records upon request of authorities.
5.	RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN
*	We erase data that is no longer needed or requested to be deleted immediately.
**It is essential that all users of the database work within these rules. Please ensure to familiarise yourself with them.**

### Annual Leave

You are entitled to annual leave as per your contract. You should always notify your supervisor as far in advance as possible before booking leave through the intranet. If currently actively testing, ensure that you also update your availability on relevant lab calendars.

### Out of Hours Working

All researchers when working out of hours MUST contact security when they start and when they finish.  All researchers must follow the CU out of hours policy.

When working out of hours, there must be at least one other researcher of post-graduate level or above in CUCHDS who is aware of the testing session. They should be informed of the anticipated finishing time of the experiment and when it has ended and the participant has left the building.

Participants must be escorted out of the building when the testing session has finished.

### Building Access

When starting your position in the lab, we will discuss which rooms within CUCHDS you will need to secure access to. The building entrance, basement entrance, and child side of the basement testing area can all be granted access via university security and your student/employee ID. All other rooms that require key card entry (e.g., PhD and MSc offices, EEG/eyetracking lab, fNIRS lab, coding room, etc) can be granted access via the Psychology key card. PIs (Ross & Sarah) must submit requests to update who has access at each door. When requesting access from the PIs make sure that you include your student or staff ID number.

### Slack

https://tinytotots.slack.com

Slack is a work-based messenger that members of the Tiny To Tots team use to communicate with each other. This acts as a nice alternative to keeping track of email threads. We use this messenger to communicate about projects (most projects have their own Channel), chat in small groups or message each other individually.

Please take a bit of time to get familiar with the platform. It's handy to download onto your phone (if you are comfortable doing so). You can find this at the App Store or at Google Play. You should find this guide helpful: https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/200111606

You can use this channel to communicate with other Tiny To Tots summer interns or members of the team. You can tag users in a message by adding an @ sign and then typing their name to get their attention.

GUIDELINES FOR USE: You can use Slack for any project or work-related conversations. We ask that you are polite and considerate when using Slack. 
1. Please use appropriate and considerate language. 
2. Please don’t message users during the night. Everyone needs downtime from work and you can set your account to “snooze” at certain times – please respect the “snooze” hours that users create. If it’s urgent, please email your supervisor.
3. Please do not spam channels with irrelevant stuff. We all like to have relaxed interactions on Slack and have fun. But remember, we all get notified for each message on a channel which can be distracting. Please use direct messages for more “casual” chats with individuals. 
4. MOST IMPORTANTLY: Do NOT upload any personal or sensitive participant data onto Slack. We have alternative storage on REDCap and on the shared drive for this purpose.
@kelsey.frewin and @sgerson are the administrators for Slack so please direct any questions or issues to us about Slack’s usage after checking the Slack guide: https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/200111606

### Shared Drive (rds)

smb://rds.cf.ac.uk/2018/54958125

### RedCap

https://tinytotots-surveys.cardiff.ac.uk/redcap/

REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a web-browser based software for creating research databases. It’s free to use for academic and non-profit institutions. The Tiny To Tots REDCap system is a secure, multi-user and multi-site software that allows us to safely store our databases. Your REDCap account is linked to your Cardiff University account which ensures that our data is kept safe within Cardiff University.

We use REDCap as our primary database storage system. Below are general instructions for using REDCap. 
For information and instructions about the Tiny To Tots Research Panel and recruitment related REDCap projects, please see the “Participant Recruitment” section.
